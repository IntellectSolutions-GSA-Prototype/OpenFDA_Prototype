01c0: NG INFORMATION See FDA-approved Medication Guide. Patients shoul
0200: d be informed of the potential risks and benefits of BYETTA and 
0240: of alternative modes of therapy. Patients should also be fully i
0280: nformed about self-management practices, including the importanc
02c0: e of proper storage of BYETTA, injection technique, timing of do
0300: sage of BYETTA and concomitant oral drugs, adherence to meal pla
0340: nning, regular physical activity, periodic blood glucose monitor
0380: ing and HbA1c testing, recognition and management of hypoglycemi
03c0: a and hyperglycemia, and assessment for diabetes complications. 
0400: 17.1 Never Share a BYETTA Pen Between Patients Advise patients t
0440: hat they should never share a BYETTA pen with another person, ev
0480: en if the needle is changed, because doing so carries a risk for
04c0:  transmission of blood-borne pathogens. 17.2 Risk of Pancreatiti
0500: s Patients should be informed that persistent severe abdominal p
0540: ain that may radiate to the back and which may or may not be acc
0580: ompanied by vomiting, is the hallmark symptom of acute pancreati
05c0: tis. Patients should be instructed to promptly discontinue BYETT
0600: A and contact their physician if persistent severe abdominal pai
0640: n occurs [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ]. 17.3 Risk of Hyp
0680: oglycemia The risk of hypoglycemia is increased when BYETTA is u
06c0: sed in combination with a sulfonylurea. Therefore, patients rece
0700: iving BYETTA and a sulfonylurea may require a lower dose of the 
0740: sulfonylurea to reduce the risk of hypoglycemia. Patients should
0780:  be informed that it is also possible that the use of BYETTA wit
07c0: h other glucose-independent insulin secretagogues (e.g., megliti
0800: nides) could increase the risk of hypoglycemia. When BYETTA is u
0840: sed in combination with insulin, evaluate the dose of insulin. C
0880: onsider reducing the dose of insulin in patients at increased ri
08c0: sk of hypoglycemia [see Adverse Reactions (6.1) ]. Patients trea
0900: ted with BYETTA should be informed that the concurrent use of BY
0940: ETTA with prandial insulin has not been studied and cannot be re
0980: commended. The symptoms, treatment, and conditions that predispo
09c0: se to development of hypoglycemia should be explained to the pat
0a00: ient. The patient's usual instructions for hypoglycemia manageme
0a40: nt should be reviewed and reinforced when initiating BYETTA ther
0a80: apy, particularly when concomitantly administered with a sulfony
0ac0: lurea or insulin [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ]. 17.4 Ris
0b00: k of Renal Impairment Patients treated with BYETTA should be inf
0b40: ormed of the potential risk for worsening renal function and inf
0b80: ormed about associated signs and symptoms of renal dysfunction, 
0bc0: as well as the possibility of dialysis as a medical intervention
0c00:  if renal failure occurs [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4) ]. 
0c40: 17.5 Risk of Hypersensitivity Reactions Patients should be infor
0c80: med that serious hypersensitivity reactions have been reported d
0cc0: uring postmarketing use of BYETTA. If symptoms of hypersensitivi
0d00: ty reactions occur, patients must stop taking BYETTA and seek me
0d40: dical advice promptly [see Warnings and Precautions (5.7) ]. 17.
0d80: 6 Use in Pregnancy Patients should be advised to inform their ph
0dc0: ysicians if they are pregnant or intend to become pregnant. 17.7
0e00:  Instructions Each dose of BYETTA should be administered as a SC
0e40:  injection in the thigh, abdomen, or upper arm at any time withi
0e80: n the 60-minute period before the morning and evening meals (or 
0ec0: before the two main meals of the day, approximately 6 hours or m
0f00: ore apart). BYETTA should not be administered after a meal. If a
0f40:  dose is missed, the treatment regimen should be resumed as pres
0f80: cribed with the next scheduled dose. Patients should be advised 
0fc0: that treatment with BYETTA may result in a reduction in appetite
1000: , food intake, and/or body weight, and that there is no need to 
1040: modify the dosing regimen due to such effects. Treatment with BY
1080: ETTA may also result in nausea, particularly upon initiation of 
10c0: therapy [see Adverse Reactions (6) ]. The patient should read th
1100: e Medication Guide and the Pen User Manual before starting BYETT
1140: A therapy and review them each time the prescription is refilled
1180: . The patient should be instructed on proper use and storage of 
11c0: the pen, emphasizing how and when to set up a new pen and noting
1200:  that only one setup step is necessary at initial use. The patie
1240: nt should be advised not to share the pen and needles. Patients

0740: e that the use of BYETTA with other glucose-independent insulin

0940: stage renal disease receiving dialysis, single doses of BYETTA 5
0980:  mcg were not well tolerated due to gastrointestinal side effect
09c0: s. Because BYETTA may induce nausea and vomiting with transient

0a40:  be applied when initiating or escalating doses of BYETTA from 5
0a80:  to 10 mcg in patients with moderate renal impairment (creatinin

0e40: estinal Disease BYETTA has not been studied in patients with sev

1740: poglycemia The risk of hypoglycemia is increased when BYETTA is

1800:  sulfonylurea to reduce the risk of hypoglycemia. When BYETTA is
