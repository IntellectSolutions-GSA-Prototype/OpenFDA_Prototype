        Every prescription drug (including biological drug products) approved by FDA for human use comes with FDA-approved labeling. The openFDA drug product labeling API provides data for prescription and over-the-counter (OTC) drug labeling. Since mid-2009, labeling has been posted publicly in the Structured Product Labeling (SPL) format.
